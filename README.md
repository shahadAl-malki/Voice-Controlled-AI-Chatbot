Voice-Controlled-AI-Chatbot
Overview: This project is a voice-controlled chatbot that enables real-time spoken conversations between a human and a machine. The user can speak directly into the microphone, and the chatbot understands the spoken input, processes it using AI, and responds with natural-sounding speech. This creates an interactive and hands-free communication experience.

Key Features:

Converts spoken input to text using speech recognition.

Uses an AI model to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.

Converts text responses to speech using a text-to-speech engine.

Enables real-time voice interaction without the need for typing or reading.

Technologies Used:

Python

SpeechRecognition library (for converting voice to text)

ElevenLabs API or pyttsx3 (for converting text to speech)

OpenAI GPT model or custom logic for generating responses

Microphone and speaker hardware for input/output

How It Works:

The user speaks into the microphone.

The speech is transcribed to text.

The chatbot processes the input and generates a response.

The response is spoken aloud using a TTS engine.

Applications:

Virtual assistants

Accessibility tools for users with visual or physical impairments

Educational tools

Human-computer interaction research
